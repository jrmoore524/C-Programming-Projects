Description : This program will calculate the monthly payment of a mortgage loan. It will ask the user
for the cost of the house, the amount of the down payment, the yearly interest rate (as a percent like 4.5),
and the number of months for the loan, and allow the user to input the values. It will then calculate the amount
borrowed, monthly payment, total of payments, and the total interest paid, and ouput the amounts
