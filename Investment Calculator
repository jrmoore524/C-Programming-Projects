Description : This program will calculate the performance of a investment. It will ask the user for the amount of principal,
the interest rate as a percent (like 1.2), the number of times interest is compounded per year, and the number of years that
the investment will last, and let the user input the values. It will then caluculate the ending balance, and the amount of
interest paid over the years of the inventment, and output the amounts
