Programmer : Jesse Moore

Description : This program will give the user 3 choices.
* For choice 1,the program will ask the user for two integers, and output the integers and their total. It will repeat
this process until one of the numbers is negative. If one of the numbers is negative the program will tell the user that
one of the numbers is negative, and reset to the main menu
* For choice 2, the program will ask the user for two lower-case strings, and tell the user which one would come first
alphabetically. It will repeat this process until the lower-case string "stop" is used as one of the strings, and then
it will reset to the main menu
* For choice 3, the program will end
