Description : This program is based on the game "The King of the Mountain". This program will ask the user for the
name of a text file to get input from. The file will contain a unknown number of integers and the first number in the 
file will be set to the king. The program will then print the numbers, one per line, after testing if the new number
is larger than the king. The program will then tell the user which number is the largest out of all the numbers in the
file (the king of the mountain).
